# Duck Planner
Below is an overview of our adherence to the original project plan as well as future goals for the project.

## Project Plan Adherence
Since we lost a member of our group midway through the project requirement discussion, we were unable to complete one of our original goals. This goal revolved around developing a sorting algorithm that would calculate the minimum distance between classes per day. This implementation would have allowed students with hindered mobility to select a schedule that would accommodate their needs. Unfortunately, we attempted to implement this sorting algorithm, but failed due to the time constraints and lack of personnel. 

## Future Goals
1. Integration with University Systems
   * Automate the enrollment process by linking the DuckPlanner schedule directly to the official class registration system.. This would remove the need for a constant asynchronous web scraper. Furthermore, it would allow our services to directly add to a student's registration cart.
2. Multi Campus Support
   * Ideally, we want to expand our services to support scheduling for students in different campuses or universities, adapting to the unique scheduling needs and structures of various institutions.
3. Automatic Registration
   * This is the most far-fetched goal, but we want to allow students to asynchronously register for classes when a student's specific registration window is open. This would allow students who use our service to ensure that they will register at the earliest available time slot.
4. Transfer to React
   * When starting the project, our group had very little experience with frontend development. As such, we were forced to use pure JS as our primary driver. However, given more time, we would like to transfer our website to react for increased modularity and a more streamlined structure.
